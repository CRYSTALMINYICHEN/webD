                <p>Recommended for age 8 to 10</p>
                <p>It's So Amazing! was created in response to repeated requests from parents, teachers, librarians, and health professionals for an up-to-date book about sex and sexuality for children who were still too young for It's Perfectly Normal. Once again, the Bird and Bee are up to their antics, but this time they're younger. In It's So Amazing!, these reassuring characters reflect the many moods of children age 7 and up: silly, serious, curious, embarrassed. Their voices echo the thoughts, questions, and concerns of a younger audience.</p>

                <p>Recommended for age 8 to 10</p>
                <p>The story begins with Nicholas, 7, and Jenny, 5, learning about different types of science in their class - from ecology to the digestive system. Then Meg Hickling, a guest speaker, comes to talk to them about a new type of science. Hickling talks about the "science names" for the children's body parts, about good and bad touches and about making babies. She coaches the children not to be embarrassed or shy about body science: "We are going to make this just like a science lesson, we will learn to think like a scientist and we will learn the scientific names for our private parts," she says.</p>
